- Try the MERT-v1-330M model. But modelscope deceived me that it outputs text, but it actually outputs vectors. It's hard to deal with these vectors.

- Now there're two ways to go. One is to train or find models dealing with these tensors. The other is to find models music -> text. I think the latter is more feasible.
